A tool created to allow musicians to work together in creating a music track. Multiple recordings can be uploaded and composited together and then played back in one stream, with the ability to enable or disable a specific track at any time.

Because all tracks are public, songs can be "open sourced" to allow anyone to collaborate asynchronously and then vote on the combinations that end up producing the best final result.

This application was developed for the UNC/Duke HackBlue hackathon.
